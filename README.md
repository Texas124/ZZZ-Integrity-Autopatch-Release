### Having Trouble?
- If you have invalid path, you can change game patch by deleting `main\game directory.txt` or edit the path inside
- If the `.zip` or `.exe` disappear, disable your antivirus (you can enable again after patching) or add this program as exception
- Run the `.exe` as admin if it crashes when patching
- Make sure you have the game up to date from the launcher
- This will not work if you dont have any `_remote` files inside `\persistent` folder.

## Antivirus Bypass
This program is not licensed so it will detected as virus

Here is what you can do:
1. If you using chromium browser, when downloading in progress there is option to keep the files
