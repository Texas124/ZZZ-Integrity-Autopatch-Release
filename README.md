4. Done!

### Having Trouble?
- If the `.zip` or `.exe` disappear, disable your antivirus (you can enable again after patching) or add this program as exception
- Run the `.exe` as admin if it crashes when patching
- This will not work if you dont have any `_remote` files inside `\persistent` folder.

## Updating
1. If you have saved `game directory`, opening `.exe` will automatically patch if necessary
2. You can change game path by deleting `game directory.txt` or just simply edit the path inside
3. You might also need to update `\main\key.pem` and `\main\url.txt` later.

## Antivirus Bypass
This program is not licensed so it will detected as virus

Here is what you can do:
1. If you using chromium browser, when downloading in progress there is option to keep the files
