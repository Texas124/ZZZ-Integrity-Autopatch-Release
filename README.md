### Note
- Run the `.exe` as admin if it crashes when patching
- If you Encounter error fetching data, press `enter` to retry the fetches
- If you put an incorrect path it will ask for the directory path again
- Directory path wil be saved to `\main\game directory.txt`
- This will not work if you dont have any `_remote` files inside `\persistent` folder.

## Updating
1. If you have saved `game directory`, opening `.exe` will automatically patch if necessary
2. You can change game path by deleting `game directory.txt` or just simply edit the path inside
3. You might also need to update `\main\key.pem` and `\main\url.txt` later.

## Uninstallation
- Delete `.exe` and `main` folder.
